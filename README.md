# Miller-Rabin

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Miller-Rabin primality test and a few other prime number-based functions. I've occasionally found them useful for coding challenges and that kind of thing, however this was really just an exercise for myself while learning to use `pytest`.     

## Navigation
